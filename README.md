# nutclientdll
Windows port of the libnutclient library (https://github.com/networkupstools/nut)
I found that libnutclient from the above doesn't compile under modern Windows, so I created this port (may be built under :inux as well). Only the libnutclient code is ported here. Under Windows this lient will work only in blocking socket mode.
